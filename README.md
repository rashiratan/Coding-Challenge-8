# Coding-Challenge-8
This is a repository for Coding-Challenge-8 for the ISM3232 Class where we will create a Employee Management System.
In this project, we will use classes in JavaScript OOP, to create a employee management system to store the database of employees in a company.
The system would: 
1. Store employee information, such as name, position, salary, and department. 
2. Store department information, including department name and employees within the department. 
3. Calculate the total salary for a department. 
4. Handle bonuses for specific employees based on their performance. 
5. Allow for different types of employees, such as regular employees and managers, each with unique properties.
